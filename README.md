Shred Searcher

Shred searcher is a brand new way to checkout mountains in the New England area. This is a single page application built using react.js. You can look at the monutains for each state, then see a bunch of useful information about each mountain.

You also have the option to add a mountain into the database through the 'Add Mountain' page.
You will need to fill in the imformation asked and then once submitted, you will get a notification saying it's been added. It will then show up in the corresponding state.

Important Inforamtion:

This is a project by Andrew Staveley for Flatiron School

The front-end website is hosted onto Netlify, while the back-end is hosted onto Render.

Built using React.js

When initially loading into the webite, it may take up to a minute for Render to 'spin-up' the
database, and load in the content after periods of inactivity.
