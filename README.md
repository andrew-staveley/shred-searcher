Shred Searcher

Shred searcher is a brand new way to checkout mountains in the New England area. This is a single page application built using react.js. You can look at the monutains for each state, then see a bunch of useful information about each mountain.

You also have the option to add a mountain into the database through the 'Add Mountain' page.
